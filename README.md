google-calendar-massiveshare
============================

Small application to synchronize the access rights (ACL) of a google calendar with a CSV / Excel file

You have to download the google api client by yourself. The maven repository is quite messy right now and there are some bugs and missing classes. You may refer to the .classpath file to see the ones I have.

Don't forget to get a key from google for your application and then download the corresponding 'client_secrets.json' into the src directory.
